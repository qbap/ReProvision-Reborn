## ReProvision Reborn
Re-sign applications on your device.

This project aims at making it easier to (re-)sign iOS and Apple Watch applications on a **jailbroken** iOS device, allowing users to avoid the 7-day limit of free certificates associated with their normal Apple account.

### Features
- Automatic re-signing of locally provisioned applications
- Basic settings to configure alerts shown when applications are (re-)signed
- Ability to install any ``.ipa`` file downloaded through Safari from the device
- Support for (re-)signing Apple Watch applications
- 3D Touch menu for starting a new re-signing routine directly from the Homescreen
- URL scheme to install ipa file from URL

Battery optimisations are also in place through the usage of a background daemon to handle automatic signing.

## URL scheme
ReProvision Reborn supports URL scheme.
    ```
    reprovision://install?url=<IPA URL>
    ```

## Notes
[The original project, ReProvision](https://github.com/Matchstic/ReProvision), has been EOL after Apple changed the process of application provisioning on their servers. This fork of ReProvision attempts to maintain the project and get it up-to-date with support for iOS 13 and above, which also explains the rename of the project.

Although this is an attempt at resurrecting the project, I ask that you **do not bother** the original developer about specific updates made to **this** fork, since they're no longer behind the project.

### Support
Attempting to maintain this fork comes at the cost of "dropping" tvOS and macOS support, since other viable options, such as [AltStore](https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore) and AltDeploy are available for their respective platforms; the main focus of this fork is iOS.

Furthermore, while re-distribution of this software is allowed, support for modified versions of this software will not be provided.  

### Account Handling
Like most provisioning software, ReProvision supports free and paid development Apple accounts. While crendentials are stored in the device's Keychain for subsequent re-use, they're only sent to Apple's iTunes Connect API for authentication.

### AltStore vs ReProvision
This fork of ReProvision uses the same techniques that AltStore uses to tackle provisioning, and by no means should be considered as a competitor.

### Contributing
Pull requests, which add a new feature or fix a bug/error, or issue tickets are welcome. Check out the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/sohsatoh/ReProvision-Reborn/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further information.

## Building
As long as you have standard libraries for Xcode projects, the only dependencies you need are [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [iOSOpenDev](https://github.com/Matchstic/iOSOpenDev.git). You can build the project with 3 simple steps
1. ``git clone https://github.com/sohsatoh/ReProvision-Reborn.git``
2. ``pod install`` in the project's root directory
3. Open ``ReProvision.xcworkspace``, and roll from there
